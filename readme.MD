# ‚ú® MONKEYTECH CODING CHALLENGE ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-FINISHED-brightgreen)

The Jungle amusement park has developed the FastRider system to improve visitor experience by allowing them to reserve a slot for their favorite ride and use a dedicated line without the need for additional payment. The system works by allowing the user to enter the main page, select the desired ride, enter their PIN code and reserve a time slot. After verifying the details, an access code is obtained, which allows the user to access the shortened line during their reserved time slot.

The web application view includes these parts:

- Screens should be designed as close as possible to the provided mockups.
- The Open Sans font should be used.
- The specified colors should be used for the background, text, and buttons.
- The submit button on mobile devices should be fixed to the bottom of the screen and displayed only after scrolling to the beginning of the list.
- To select a desired facility, the user should click on the relevant cube.
- The active selection should be highlighted using the color of the relevant area as the background color.

The validations should be:

- The server enforces several bonus requirements, such as FastRider cards cannot be issued outside the park's operating hours.
- Users cannot issue more than one card in a given period of time.
- The ticket code (PIN #) must follow a specific format.
- The developer should implement a solution that saves the user from retyping their card code every time.
